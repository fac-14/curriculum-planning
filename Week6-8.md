# Week - 6 

## Day 1

## White board walkthrough 
N/A 

##  workshop on SQL commands and psql
Eve- The psql portion was only at the end of the workshop, pgcli was much better. 

**Action point** - Make sure PGCLI is covered and emphasised. Introduce it PGCLI. Raise issues as neccesary.  

## Day 2

## PG Module codealong
N/A

## Workshop on make small node app with db connction
N/A

##  Database Testing

If week two is updated to include jest, every other week has to be updated to use JEST. 

It didn't introudce how to use database testing inside a project. 

A guide on how to setup a database on Travis is also very important, properly setting up enviroment variable. At that point you can specify which database to use. None of that was included in the material. 

**Action Point** - Guide on how to test up test enviroment and production enviroment with travis. 

Workshop reliant on you having complted morning challnege


##  Introduce Project

It would be quite usefull to show people others projects and how they used testing of databases.

##  Research Afternoon

Database Migration -  Groups felt they wanted more help in database migration and how it works. (maybe, haven't had to worry about this)

Instead maybe this could be- How to have multiple databases and how it could be setup in travis. This could be far more usefull than getting lost in the internet. 

Considerations of other types of databases - MongoDB and it's alternatives. 


## Continue work on projects

## Day 5
 During code review advise people they can choose to make their app look better, or make it work better, the latter will be better if they choose to take their app forward into week 7



# Week 7 Authentication 



## Day 1 

###  Introduction to learning outcomes 
Action Points- make sure everyone reads the presentation you are going to give. 

###   Presentation on password management

-- Make sure you are using BcryptJS

This was a very short workshop, maybe space for something more. 

If there space in another workshop, it would be cool to use BcryptJS()

Another suggestion is that this space could be used for a promise workshop since it's introduced the following day.



###  Workshop on Cookies 



## Day 2

### Morning Challenge on client side validation 

### Workshop on stateless session management. 

### Research Topics 



## Day 3 

Promise workshop: 
It was good. It had pokemon. Too many api calls at the same time? Whoever is doing week 7 could explain that last portion with the oran ball. Not everyone did finish this but it’s within everyones abilities so give more time

Note on projects-- If a group decides to take their previous week project forward into the next, they should be warned that it’s very difficult. 

During code review advise people they can choos to make their app look better, or make it work better, the lattter will be better if they choose to take their app forward into week 7






# Week – 8  


Introduction to Express : 

- Everyone was happy in Nazareth
- Some people disliked a code along, not enough variation in the exercises.
- Make sure to turn of Auto-complete of so the screen isn’t blocked.
- The code along didn’t have handlebars, just express. Before we were familiar with that we were shown handlebars and expected to use it.

Creating and testing express routes: 

​- Postman is encouraged in the documentation, then the mentors need to be familiar with postman. 


## Day 2 

### Create an animated app draw 
- It was good fun.

### Handlebars workshop

- There were many files to look through. When your new to express, the amount of fruit related files/names can be very confusing. Suggestion to have mentors explain the file structure a lot more.

- More of an introduction to what Templating is, as an explanation to what it is and how common it is.

- Layouts and partials file structure should be emphasized, it’s not arbitrary. Broader introduction to MVC – MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER

- Explain why the index.js is called what it is.


### White-board Walk-through 

- Actually do it this time around.
- Best practices for file structure, naming etc
​

### Research Afternoon

- Sessions could use more clarifying since it’s such a common word.






## Wednesday


### Express- Handlebars – Morning Challenge 

- It was a little short, more could be added onto it.



### Projects 

Server Rendered Full Stack App 

​- Warn people for using too many new things, it could eat up too much of their time. Kates presentation as a warning. 
-Emphasis on scoping things in an achievable. 
- SUNK COST FALLACY
- Introduction to the idea of an MVP( Focus on what you’ve learned instead of adding more)
